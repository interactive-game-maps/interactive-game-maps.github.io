### I found a misplaced or missing marker in one of the included maps
Please head over to the linked repository and feel free to open an issue or pull request there.
You can turn on the edit mode in the side panel, place your marker(s) and export them in the edit side panel through the lowermost button.
It'll give you a geoJson with all markers of the edit layer which we'll then include in the code.
